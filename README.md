# Data Structures and Algorithms in C 

> Executing core algorithms... ⚙️
This repository contains a variety of projects written in the C programming language. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem or implementing a particular data structure and algorithm.

## Projects
* **Campus Navigation System (Graph Traversal):** A C program that models a university campus network using an adjacency matrix. It implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between buildings and Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect disconnected areas.
* **Browser History Simulation (Stack Structure):** A C program simulating web browser navigation (Visit, Back, Forward). It uses a Stack data structure (LIFO - Last In, First Out) with arrays to manage the history logic and handle edge cases gracefully.

## How to Run
To run any project from this repository, follow these steps:

### Requirements
Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fxusuf/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C.git
   cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd ProjectName
   ```
3. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o output
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
